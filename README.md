This Employee Salary Calculation Program calculates employee salaries based on their position (Manager, Developer, or Intern) and hours worked, accounting for overtime. It validates inputs for correct positions and positive hours, handling errors by skipping invalid entries. The program uses a switch statement for position-based rates, calculates overtime using a conditional statement, and processes multiple employees efficiently with a for loop, ensuring smooth execution even with invalid data.
